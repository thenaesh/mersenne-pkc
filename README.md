# MersennePKC


MersennePKC is an implementation of a proposed post-quantum public-key cryptosystem proposed in the [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/481.pdf).
It is based on the hardness of distinguishing a quotient of two numbers with small Hamming weight in a finite field whose order is some Mersenne prime.
